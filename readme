This repo contains a Docker setup for running EnergyPlus models.

To use it, follow the procedure below:

1. open one terminal and cd into the root directory, type "make build_python" 

2. type "make run_python config/$config$ $start$ $dev$".
$config$ can be "Atlanta.config" or "Denver.config", $start$ is the index of hour (0 to 24*7, interval 0.5), $dev$ is the deviation of the cooling setpoint from its nominal value.

3. open another terminal and cd into the root directory, type "make build_eplus"

4. type "make run_eplus wea =$wea$  city = $city$". Note that right now there are two options for $wea$ and $city$, respectively.
$wea$ can be "atlanta" or "denver" while $city$ can be "Atlanta" or "Denver".
