$wea$ can be "atlanta" or "denver" while $city$ can be "Atlanta" or "Denver".

3. open another terminal and cd into the root directory, type "python server.py config/$config$ $start_time$ $deviation$".
$config$ can be "Atlanta.config" or "Denver.config", $start_time$ is the index of hour (0 to 24*7, interval 0.5), $deviation$ is the deviation of the cooling setpoint from its nominal value.
